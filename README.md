# Test Assignment

this Application was written 100% in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) using [BLoC](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) pattern.

## How does it works
This app using a local DB as Authentication storage called ```Hive```. Initially, there's no registered user so we have to go to Signup in order to create a new user then  we can use it later.

For medications, the app using a mockup which can be found [here](https://run.mocky.io/v3/55feede9-58c6-4dad-a609-6426e91b72f8).

Please feel free to contact me for any questions or concerns.
Thank you.
